## Is the site responsive?
It's built using bootstrap 4 and will adjust to different screen sizes. Please resize each page and view for yourself.
Additional media queries have also been made in the capstone.css file.

## Is the site well-styled?
Most of the styling has been done through the use of bootstrap 4 classes. Additional tweaks can be found in the css file.

## Are the images incorporated effectively?
I have a carousel in the landing page and a couple of images in the about page. The carousel images will resize to width: 100% as the media width gets sufficiently large. This prevents the image from stopping part way through the page on larger devices.

## Successfully demonstrated the ability to enhance their site?
-  The nav collapses to a nav burger for smaller devices.
-  I've added a hover transition to the nav.
-  Tabs in exercises.html are stacked vertically for larger devices and at the top for smaller devices.
-  [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) was used for javascript code syntax highlighting in exercises.html.
-  I've used the "sr-only" class to better cater to people using screen readers.
